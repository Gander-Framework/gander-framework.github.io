      <h2 id="introduction">1) Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Gander allows developers to create temporary deployments of their latest code changes upon creating a pull request. These deployments, known as "review apps", serve as isolated environments to visually examine UI changes and interactively test new and updated behaviours. Because these deployments are accessible via a shareable link, reviewers no longer have to download the code base and build the application, and developers can easily include non-technical stakeholders in these reviews. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Built on top of GitHub Actions, AWS, and Node.js, Gander creates infrastructure for hosting your review apps and fully automates the process of spinning up, managing, and tearing them down. Gander is open-source, self-hosted, and ready to use within minutes of installation.
      </p>
      <h3 id="design-goals">1.1) Design Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Gander is a tool to automate review apps and ultimately make the code review process more convenient for developers and more accessible to non-technical team members. We designed Gander with the following goals in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Convenience — </strong> The tool should be easy to install and configure, and it should automatically spin up a review app for every pull request.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility — </strong>The tool can be dropped into any existing pipeline or CI/CD workflow with minimal setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Efficiency — </strong> The user should only incur expenses for the resources used on AWS, with no need for an opaque monthly fee.</li>
        <li><strong>Control — </strong> The tool should rely on the user's cloud infrastructure, so the user can maintain control over their own data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="gander-features">1.2) Gander Features</h3>
      <p>
        As review apps are simply tools to make the development and reviewing processes more convenient, we strove to make Gander as easy to use and as configuration-free as possible. Simply bring a code repository and your AWS credentials, and Gander takes care of the rest. With a simple command in our CLI and no required config files, Gander users can:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Provision all AWS resources required to create the infrastructure needed to host the review apps</li>
        <li>Tear down all AWS resources used in said infrastructure </li>
        <li>
          Initialize a GitHub repository to:
          <ul>
            <li>build a review app upon opening or committing to a pull request</li>
            <li>tear down the review app upon closing the pull request</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to automating all builds and tear downs, Gander:
        <ul>
          <li>Generates a live, semantic URL with your custom domain for each review app</li>
          <li>Posts this URL on the pull request of the corresponding review app</li>
          <li>Maintains the URL through PR updates</li>
          <li>Supports multiple languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Go</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-gander-supports">1.3) What Gander Supports</h3>
      <p>Currently, Gander only supports:
        <ul>
          <li>Existing GitHub repositories</li>
          <li>Monolithic application architectures: if your application has components split across multiple code bases, then Gander isn't a compatible review app solution</li>
          <li>Applications using a PostgreSQL database</li>
          <li>Hosting review apps on AWS infrastructure</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 id="review-apps">2) Review Apps</h2>
      <p>Review apps are <em>ephemeral apps</em>, meaning they're temporary deployments with a self-contained version of your app [1, 4]. Generally speaking, these apps are created on demand each time a feature needs to be reviewed and then automatically deleted when the review is completed and the pull request is closed [1].</p>
      <p>Review apps are easily shared, making it possible to include not only developers, but also non-technical reviewers during development. Team members such as designers, project managers, and clients can receive a link, try out new features in a browser and give feedback [2]. </p>
      <blockquote>Review Apps provide easier and better testing for features and fixes in isolation . . . [They] speed up team decision-making so that you can deliver better apps faster, and with greater confidence.
        
        <br /><br />
- Heroku Pipelines [2, 3]
      </blockquote>

      <h3 id="development-without-review-apps">2.1) Development without Review Apps</h3>
      <p>
        When developing a new feature, developers typically follow some development cycle like the following:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/dev_flow_1.png" alt="Development cycle without review apps" />
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a feature branch</li>
        <li>Develop feature on feature branch</li>
        <li>Open pull request to receive code reviews and merge feature</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After the feature is merged back into the main branch, this feature will typically go through some development pipeline, which may include stages such as testing, QA checks, and deploying the application to a staging environment meant to mimic production conditions. The new feature is only reviewed visually in the later stages of the pipeline, possibly as late as the deployment to the staging environment. 
      </p>
      <p>Thus, without review apps, non-technical stakeholders are only involved within the reviewing process after the code is merged, the PR is closed, and the app is deployed to some viewing environment such as staging. This means if there's an issue with some new feature, our developer would have to repeat the development cycle of branching, developing and merging before receiving another review. Moreover, the code itself would have to go through all the stages of the development pipeline before being viewed once again [1]. </p>
      
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/dev_flow_w_o_review.png" alt="Development cycle without review apps" />
      </div>
      <h3 id="development-with-review-apps">2.1) Development with Review Apps</h3>
      <P>Review apps provide an easy way to shorten the feedback loop between developers and non-developers. With review apps, our developer's cycle from above may now look something like this:</P>
      
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/dev_flow_w_review.png" alt="Development cycle without review apps" />
      </div>
      <p>Before merging the feature into the main branch, we can create a review app and share it with other developers, designers, and clients for a truly well-rounded review process involving all stakeholders. Developers viewing the code will no longer have to guess what the code does, as they can interact with the application directly in their browser [2]. Designers can see how their creations integrate with users' interactions and experiences. Clients can step into their users' shoes and truly understand the digital experience created from their guidelines.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, by involving more team members earlier within the development process, review apps can shorten the feedback loop and speed up the time for development [3]. This means that buggy code can be caught earlier in the process by QA teams, and never gets merged in the first place. This leads to a higher velocity of development, leading to an overall reduced cost of development.</p>
      <p>All in all, review apps are a convenient tool to help developers:
        <ul>
          <li>review and get feedback on features earlier within a development cycle,</li>
          <li>include more people - both developers and non-developers - in the reviewing process,</li>
          <li>review code changes both visually and through code reviews.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <h2 id="existing-solutions">3) Existing Solutions</h2>
      <p>Generally speaking, there are two categories of review app solutions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Review apps as a feature</li>
        <li>Review apps as a service</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="review-apps-as-a-feature">3.1) Review Apps as a Feature</h3>
      <p>The first category is review apps as a feature of a larger service. For example, products like Heroku Pipelines provide review apps as one part of a full continuous delivery pipeline they call Heroku Flow. For some users, this would be an excellent fit, due to the convenience of delegating all stages of the development pipeline to a service. However, this solution will not be the right fit for all developers, as using such pipeline services imposes certain restrictions upon the user:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users must follow the service's specific pipeline model, offering less flexibility and choice in your development cycle model.</li>
        <li>These services typically require the user to host their application on the service's infrastructure. In the context of Heroku, it's not just the review applications that are hosted on Heroku's infrastructure - it's also the live production deployment. For data-conscious developers, this trades away access and control of your application's code and infrastructure. </li>
        <li>Services like this are not an option for organizations that have their own existing deployment solution and simply want to introduce review apps into their development cycle without migrating to an entirely new platform.</li>
        <li>Not all developers may be willing to spend the higher price involved in purchasing a larger feature package than just review apps. </li>
      </ul>
      <P>GitLab Review Apps offer a solution similar to Heroku's, with the distinction that GitLab is open-source. Otherwise, the tradeoffs are similar, as the user must use GitLab as a code-hosting service in order to take advantage of their review app feature. </P>
      <P>For developers looking for just a simple review app solution and not a whole development pipeline or code-hosting service, review applications as a feature aren't an ideal solution.</P>
      <h3 id="review-apps-as-a-service">3.2) Review Apps as a Service</h3>
      <p>The second category is review apps as a service. Services like Tugboat and Reploy offer a proprietary, configurable platform for deploying and managing review apps. These platforms include many useful features beyond simply deploying a review app, such as customized build steps and integrations with other services. However, using a feature-rich review app platform does come with certain limitations: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Providing more features results in more setup and configuration responsibilities on the user. Such platforms require users to learn the platform's system and write service-specific configuration files for all previewed applications.</li>
        <li>Most of these review app services require the user to host their applications on the service's infrastructure, limiting the user's control over their code and deployments.</li>
        <li>Services charge users a flat subscription fee, and sometimes an additional fee based on the number of users per account, number of apps deployed, or quantity of resources consumed. Such payment plans are obscure and uncorrelated to the user's actual usage on the platform.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For developers looking for an easily configurable solution where they can maintain control and pay as they go, review apps as a service is not really a good fit.</p>
      <p>The following table summarizes the attributes of these two types of review app solutions:</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/ES_table1.png" alt="review apps as a feature vs review apps as a service" />
      </div>
      <p>In spite of the generous feature sets offered by these solutions, they won't be the best fit for all development teams. If a team wants to deploy review apps without much change to their CI/CD pipeline, they won't be able to do that with a solution like Heroku's, because they impose their own pipeline model. If they want to be able to control the infrastructure their review apps are hosted on, due to security or compliance, they won't find a solution there either. Additionally, if they want a pay-as-you-go model instead of a monthly fee, these solutions are not the correct fit.</p>
      
      <h3 id="diy-solution">3.3) DIY Solution</h3>
      <p>For developers looking for a solution that keeps their code within their own network and whose only costs are those with their cloud provider, one option is to build your own in-house automated review app solution. However, building such a solution requires quite a few steps.</p>
      <p>Starting with a smaller problem, we can examine the number of steps required to deploy just one application. This results in a list of at least 13 individual steps. </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/diy_steps.png" alt="Steps to launch a review app" />
      </div>
      <p>To reach a complete review app solution, we still have quite a few considerations to make:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we want to host more than one review app at a time, do we want to repeat the steps above every time or do we want to design a long-lived infrastructure to host the apps? Will our resource utilization even be worth maintaining a long-lived infrastructure?</li>
        <li>How can we create a solution that can support multiple types of applications, each with a different set of dependencies? </li>
        <li>How can we isolate and persist each review app's data for the time the review app is alive? </li>
        <li>How can we automatically deploy these review apps?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With these considerations above, we ideally want to have some easy way to provision long-lived infrastructure when we want to create review apps frequently, and an easy way to tear down the infrastructure when we reach a development lull. We'd also want to find a way to isolate review apps and their databases from one another, whether it be deploying each app on a different server or containerizing applications. In addition, we would need to provision and configure some kind of storage method for each review app and create some method to automate all these processes. </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/ES_table2.png" alt="Table with DIY option added" />
      </div>
      <p>This DIY approach fulfills the goals of keeping code within your own network and keeping costs transparent. However, creating such a DIY solution is a large undertaking. For organizations that still want this type of solution, it would be ideal to have a customizable open-source option that provided these same benefits without the time and development costs of creating it from scratch. This is why we built Gander.</p>
      <div style="display:none;">
        <p>DiD yOu LiSt ThIs As ExPeRiEnCe?!?!?</p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">

        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 id="gander">3.4) Gander</h3>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/ES_table3.png" alt="Table with Gander as an Option" />
      </div>
      <p>Gander fills its niche by achieving the design goals we established earlier.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Convenience — </strong> Gander is easy to set up. It avoids all the hassle of developing your own internal tooling that is required with the DIY approach, as well as the configuration required when using review apps as a service. Gander provides the convenience factor of automating every build, deploy and tear down, and anyone can get Gander up and running in as little as 10 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Versatility — </strong>Services like Heroku Pipelines support many more types of application architectures and are a great option when managed hosting is sufficient for your organization's needs. Gander, on the other hand, is workflow agnostic. It's a no commitment, drop-in solution, where users are not locked in to any specific development process. Gander can be integrated at any stage in the life of an application. </li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Efficiency — </strong> We designed Gander to adhere to the "pay-as-you-go" model of cloud computing, so that you only pay for the compute you use. Because review apps are both temporary and typically fielding very light traffic, the cost of using Gander scales up or down depending on your exact needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Control — </strong> Gander's open-source code and review apps run in the user's GitHub and AWS accounts. The user maintains control over their code and expenses and won't need to trust a review app provider with their data or secrets. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the remaining sections, we discuss the decisions we made in order to architect a system that meets these goals.</p>
  
      <h2 id="architecture-overview">4) Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p>Gander uses AWS infrastructure combined with GitHub Actions to build and host review apps. We're going to do a quick overview of this architecture, and then revisit each piece to explore the design decisions that went into it.</p>
      
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/gander_overview.png" alt="Overview of Gander Architecture" />
      </div>
      <h3 id="github-actions">4.1) Github Actions</h3>
      <p>To build and remove your review apps, we leverage GitHub Actions, a workflow automation tool available from GitHub. In Gander's case, our workflows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>containerize and deploy your application to AWS upon opening or committing to a pull request, and</li>
        <li>tear down the application upon closing a pull request.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="amazon-web-services">4.2) Amazon Web Services</h3>
      <p>AWS provides all of the infrastructure required to effortlessly host, manage and view your review apps. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Elastic Container Service: </strong> To ensure that all live review apps are always up and running, the containerized applications are deployed to and managed automatically by Elastic Container Service. </li>
        <li><strong>Elastic File System:</strong> As containers, and therefore their data, are ephemeral, we persist your review app data outside of the application itself with Elastic File System. </li>
        <li><strong>Application Load Balancer:</strong> To easily reach a review app based on its semantic URL, we use an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to the correct app.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Virtual Private Cloud:</strong> To separate your Gander architecture and review apps from other resources in your AWS account, we deploy to a dedicated Virtual Private Cloud.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="command-line-interface">4.3) Command Line Interface</h3>
      <p>Gander provides a CLI so users can set up and tear down Gander infrastructure, and initialize repositories with Gander.</p>
      <h2 id="responding-to-pull-requests">5) Responding to Pull Requests</h2>
      <h3 id="why-pull-requests">5.1) Why Pull Requests</h3>
      <p>Before building and deploying review apps, we first have to decide the boundaries for this process: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When should a build be triggered? </li>
        <li>When should a build be updated? </li>
        <li>When should an app be torn down?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given our goal of enabling relevant stakeholders to review new features earlier in development, pull requests are a perfect trigger for deploying review apps. Pull requests are a mechanism by which developers notify other team members that they have a completed feature ready for review. The feature is then reviewed and approved before being merged into a more stable branch of the codebase [5].   </p>
      <p>A typical lifecycle of a pull request looks something like this:</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/pull_request_lifecycle.png" alt="Pull Request Flow Chart" />
      </div>
      <p>Since the purpose of Gander review apps is to enable team members to preview changes in a live deployment before merging, we want to run builds not only upon the opening of a pull request, but also when a new commit is made to the source branch of an existing pull request. This event is called synchronizing. As for tearing down a review app, the natural event to respond to is the closing of a pull request.</p>
      <p>After establishing the three events Gander review apps react to, we now need to consider: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do we connect the build and tear-down processes with these pull request events?</li>
        <li>Where should these processes take place?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="webhooks">5.2) Webhooks</h3>
      <p>Webhooks are a way for applications to send automatic notifications to other applications whenever a certain event occurs. These notifications usually take the form of a POST request containing a payload with any relevant metadata about the event [6]. GitHub enables webhook integrations that can send these POST requests to whatever endpoint the user specifies.</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/webhooks.png" alt="Webhook Diagram" />
      </div>
      <p>One way that we could have achieved our goal of a pull request trigger is by setting up a server whose purpose is to listen for a webhook event notifying that a pull request was opened, synchronized, or closed and to take action accordingly. To build a review app, this server would need to clone the relevant code from GitHub before it could do anything else. Doing it this way would allow more fine-grained control over the build environment — how the server itself is configured — but there are drawbacks to this approach.  </p>
      <p>First, this server would need to be online all of the time in order to listen for incoming webhook events. Outside of the time the server is actually building or tearing down a review app, it would be sitting idle. Considering that more time than not would be spent in this idle listening state, this is not resource-efficient or cost-effective.</p>
      <p>Second, since this server would live outside the boundaries of GitHub, there would be an additional authentication step required before it is allowed to interact with the repository in any meaningful way. Then, any other metadata the server needs about the repository in order to carry out its work would require additional requests over the network to GitHub's API.</p>

      <h3 id="github-actions">5.3) Github Actions</h3>
      <p>Thankfully, there is an alternative to webhooks that better suits our use-case — GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a workflow automation tool that executes on their servers, eliminating the need for our users to provision, maintain, and configure an entirely separate build server. Running our workflows on GitHub's servers through Actions also means that our users are not incurring any costs or consuming any compute resources when there is no build or tear-down to be run. GitHub Actions has a free tier available that contains 2000 minutes of compute per account per month, which can support between 200-300 pull requests per month depending on the size of your project. </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/diagrams/workflows.png" alt="GitHub Actions Diagram" />
      </div>
      <p>Additionally, GitHub Actions allows us to run these workflows within the existing context of the users' repositories, eliminating the need to authenticate with the GitHub API. We can easily access information such as the pull request number and secrets within the repository. With a separate build server, accessing this information is still possible but would require additional network requests to the GitHub API. With GitHub Actions, we can access this information natively through the API built into the servers GitHub provides. Ultimately, because of the reduced costs and the convenience of executing code in the context of the repository, this is the clear choice for Gander, particularly since one of our major design goals was keeping expenses transparent and grounded in resource-use.</p>
      <h3 id="workflows-within-gander">5.4) Workflows within Gander</h3>
      <p>There are three workflows that we inject into a project — "Create review app", "Destroy review app", and "Update review app". Here is a brief summary of what each of those actions do:</p>
      <p>Create Review App</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Build the application image</li>
        <li>Push the image to Amazon's Elastic Container Registry</li>
        <li>Create the review app's directory on Elastic File System</li>
        <li>Seed the database</li>
        <li>Register task definitions associated with the review app</li>
        <li>Add load balancer rules</li>
        <li>Launch the review app service</li>
        <li>Comment the app's URL on the pull request</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Destroy Review App</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove load balancer rules</li>
        <li>Delete task definitions associated with the review app</li>
        <li>Delete the review app service</li>
        <li>Delete the review app's directory on Elastic File System</li>
        <li>Delete associated container images from the Elastic Container Registry</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Our Update workflow simply destroys a review app, then creates a new one with the updated code. </p>
      <p>In the following sections, we'll cover what each of these steps involves in detail.</p>
